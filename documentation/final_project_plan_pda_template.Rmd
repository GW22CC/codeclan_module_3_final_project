## Context

#### Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

What insights can the business/organisation gain from your analysis and how will your analysis help the business/organisation make better decisions? 

#### Domain knowledge and the business context

Briefly describe the business/organisation and where your analysis fits within its aims/activity. 

The Scottish Household SUrvey (SHS), which began in 1999, is a continuous survey based on a sample of the general population in private residences in Scotland. It is financed by the Scottish Government. The aim of the survey is to provide representative information about the composition, characteristics and behaviours of Scottish households, both nationally and at a more local level. The survey covers a wide range of topics to allow links to be made between different policy areas, with a particular focus on information to aid policy decisions on transport and social inclusion.

From 1999 up to 2011 the survey followed a fairly consistent survey design. From 2012 onwards, the survey was substantially redesigned to include elements of the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) including the follow-up Physical Survey component. More details can be found in the survey documentation. 

This is crucial to informing the Fairer Scotland agenda, National Performance Framework and feeds in to the Scottish Surveys Core Questions (SSCQ) sample.

The Fairer Scotland Duty (the Duty) came into force on 1 April 2018 and places a legal responsibility on named public bodies in Scotland to actively consider ('pay due regard' to) how they can reduce inequalities of outcome caused by socio-economic disadvantage, when making strategic decisions.

The The National Performance Framework (NPF) measures Scotland’s progress against the National Outcomes. To do this, it uses ‘National Indicators’.

These indicators give a measure of national wellbeing. They include a range of economic, social and environmental indicators.

The Scottish Surveys Core Questions (SSCQ) is an annual Official Statistics publication. SSCQ is a result of a harmonised design across the three major Scottish Government household surveys, envisaged in the Long Term Survey Strategy. From January 2012 a set of 20 core questions have been asked in the Scottish Household Survey, the Scottish Health Survey and the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey. 

## Data

#### Internal and external data sources

Brief description of data sources both internal (provided by the organisation) and external (not sourced from the organisation's data).

The internal data files are:

- 'Distance to Green or Blue Space' 

Every year Scottish Household Survey (SHS) asks adults how long it would take them to walk to their nearest green or blue space.

The question asking about walking distance to nearest greenspace informs the National Indicator on Access to Green and Blue Spaces. However before 2019, even though the list of spaces included riversides and beaches, the question text used the term "green or open space". In 2019 for one half of the sample this was changed slightly to "green, blue or open spaces" to check if including the word "blue" made any difference to the response given to the question about walking distance or the biennial follow-up questions asking about satisfaction with and frequency of use of nearest green or blue space. No statistically significant difference was found.

The data is reported here is representative of the adult population and is available by:

• Local Authority

• Age of the randomly selected adult

• Gender of the randomly selected adult

In the 2018 SHS the gender question was revised. In previous years interviewers asked if household members were 'male' or 'female'. In the 2018 survey the options given were: 'man/boy', 'woman/girl' and two additional responses: ‘identified in another way’ and ‘refused’. In order to remain harmonised with other statistics.gov.scot datasets, the previous response options 'male' and 'female' will be maintained.

• Urban/Rural Classification

• SIMD

• Type Of Tenure

• Household Type

• Ethnicity of the randomly selected adult

- 'Community belonging' 

Every year Scottish Household Survey (SHS) asks adults how strongly they feel they belong to their immediate neighbourhood. The data is reported here on person level and is available by:

• Local Authority

• Gender of the randomly selected adult

In the 2018 Scottish Household Survey the gender question was revised. In previous years interviewers asked if household members were 'male' or 'female'. In the 2018 survey the options given were: 'man/boy', 'woman/girl' and two additional responses: ‘identified in another way’ and ‘refused’. In order to remain harmonised with other statistics.gov.scot datasets, the previous response options 'male' and 'female' will be maintained.

• Urban/Rural Classification

• SIMD - 'Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2020' The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) provides a relative ranking of the data zones in Scotland from 1 (most deprived) to 6,976 (least deprived) based on a weighted combination of data for seven domains: income, employment, health, education, skills and training, geographic access to services, crime and housing. The dataset includes ranks for each domain, as well as quantile bands for the overall and domain ranks (5%, 10% and 20%).

Each data zone is assigned to vigintiles, deciles and quintiles, with band 1 containing the most deprived data zones. For instance, SIMD decile 1 contains the most deprived 10% of data zones and decile 10 contains the least deprived 10% of data zones.

When comparing results across different iterations of SIMD, it is important to take account of changes to the methodology used to construct the individual domains and the overall SIMD between iterations, as well as changes in geographical units as data zones change for each Census.

• Type Of Tenure

• Household Type

• Ethnicity

• Walking distance to nearest green-space.


I also used the '2011 Data Zone Lookup' .csv. file which contained geography lookup tables used for aggregation, from 2011 data zones to higher level geographies.

The external data files are:




#### Types of data

What kind of data did you work with? E.g. categorical and numerical data and their sub-types.

#### Data formats

What format did your data come in? E.g. all downloaded flat files (CSV) or any data from APIs, scraping etc.

#### Data quality and bias

Briefly describe the quality of the data and whether you have any reasons to suggest the data is biased e.g. only data from a specific demographic even though a broader demographic would be of interest to the organisation.

## Ethics

#### Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

Do you have any ethical concerns regarding the sourcing and extraction of your data? 

#### Ethical implications of business requirements

Are there any ethical implications of the business requirements?

## Analysis

#### Stages in the data analysis process

What were the main stages in your data analysis process?

#### Tools for data analysis

What were the main tools you used for your analysis?

#### Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

Please report under which of the below categories your analysis falls **and why** (can be more than one) 

::: {.emphasis}
**Descriptive Analytics** tells you what happened in the past.

**Diagnostic Analytics** helps you understand why something happened in the past.

**Predictive Analytics** predicts what is most likely to happen in the future.

**Prescriptive Analytics** recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.
